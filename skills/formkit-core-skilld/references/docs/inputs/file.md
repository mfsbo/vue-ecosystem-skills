# File Input

A native HTML file input with support for multiple files, drag and drop, clearing the input, and repopulating from an array.

The `file` input uses HTML's native file input. It allows users to select files from their device for upload. In addition to native input features, it adds support for:

- Drag and drop
- Clearing the input
- Repopulating from an array

## Basic example

### Example: File input

#### file.vue

```vue
<FormKit
    type="file"
    label="Documents"
    accept=".pdf,.doc,.docx,.xml,.md,.csv"
    help="Select as many documents as you would like."
    multiple="true"
  />
```

## Array value

The value of the `file` type should always be an array of objects where each object contains a `name` (string) and optional `file` (File) property. When selecting new files from a user’s device, FormKit will convert the native FileList to the required array-based structure automatically.

This structure can be used to pre-populate a file input with previously uploaded file values:

### Example: File input

#### file-populate.vue

```vue
<FormKit
    type="file"
    label="Your files"
    help="This input starts with files already “attached”."
    multiple="true"
    :value="[{ name: 'purple-taste.pdf' }, { name: 'chocolate-recipe.docx' }]"
  />
```

> **Tip:** Pre-populating an input with file names is for display purposes only. It’s an optional feature that provides a consistent interface to convey that a file was previously uploaded — however — a FileList is not attached to the actual <input> tag for upload.

### Uploading files

The file upload process is left to your form’s submission handler. When submitting the form [via full page request](/inputs/form#submitting-as-a-page-request) no further processing is necessary, however when submitting [via XHR/Fetch request](/inputs/form#submitting-via-xhrfetch-request) you will need to create an instance of FormData with the files attached. Here is a working example:

### Example: File input

#### file-upload.vue

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { setErrors } from '@formkit/vue'
const complete = ref(false)

const submitHandler = async (data) => {
  // We need to submit this as a multipart/form-data
  // to do this we use the FormData API.
  const body = new FormData()
  // We can append other data to our form data:
  body.append('name', data.name)
  // Finally, we append the actual File object(s)
  data.license.forEach((fileItem) => {
    body.append('license', fileItem.file)
  })

  // We'll perform a real upload to httpbin.org
  const res = await fetch('https://httpbin.org/post', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: body,
  })

  if (res.ok) {
    complete.value = true
  } else {
    setErrors('licenseForm', ['The server didn’t like our request.'])
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <FormKit
    v-if="!complete"
    id="licenseForm"
    type="form"
    @submit="submitHandler"
  >
    <FormKit
      type="text"
      label="Full name"
      help="Your full name as it appears on your license"
      name="name"
      validation="required"
    />
    <FormKit
      type="file"
      label="Drivers license"
      name="license"
      help="Please add a scan of your driver’s license"
      accept=".jpg,.png,.pdf"
      validation="required"
    />
  </FormKit>
  <div v-else class="complete">License upload complete 👍</div>
</template>
```

## Props & Attributes

The `file` input has a few unique props. There are also several commonly used native HTML attributes that assist in controlling file uploads.

### Universal Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file-item-icon` | `String` | `’’` | Specifies an icon to put in the fileItemIcon section. Only shows when there is a file selected. Defaults to the fileDoc icon. |
| `file-remove-icon` | `String` | `’’` | Specifies an icon to put in the fileRemoveIcon section. Only shows when a file is selected. Defaults to the close icon. |
| `no-files-icon` | `String` | `’’` | Specifies an icon to put in the noFilesIcon section. Only shows when no file is selected. Defaults to the fileDoc icon. |

## Sections

You can target specific sections of an input using the `section-key` attribute or slots. Each section can be styled or customized independently.

## Slot Data

### Universal Slot Data

Available in all sections of this input:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `_value` | `any` | The current  |
| `_root` | `Document | ShadowRoot` | The root document or shadow root the input is inside. This can be set by using a higher-order `<FormKitRoot>` component. |
| `attrs` | `Record<string, any>` | An object of attributes that (generally) should be applied to the root <input> element. |
| `classes` | `Record<string, string>` | Classes to apply on the various sections. |
| `defaultMessagePlacement` | `boolean` | Whether or not to render messages in the standard location. |
| `describedBy` | `string` | The ID of an element that describes the input. This is generally used for screen readers. |
| `didMount` | `boolean` | Whether or not the input has been mounted. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | Whether the input is disabled. |
| `family` | `string` | The family of the input. This is generally the same as the input type but can be used to group similar inputs for styling purposes. |
| `fns` | `Record<string, (...args: any[]) => any>` | Utility functions, generally for use in the input’s schema. |
| `help` | `string` | The help text of the input |
| `handlers` | `Record<string, (...args: any[]) => void>` | Event handlers. |
| `id` | `string` | The unique id of the input. Should also be applied as the id attribute. This is generally required for accessibility reasons. |
| `items` | `symbol[]` | An array of symbols that represent the a child’s nodes. These are not the child’s nodes but are just symbols representing them. They are used to iterate over the children for rendering purposes. |
| `label` | `string` | The label of the input |
| `messages` | `Record<string, FormKitMessage>` |  A list of messages to be displayed on the input. Often these are validation messages and error messages, but other `visible` core node messages do also apply here. This object is only populated when the validation should be actually displayed. |
| `node` | `FormKitNode` | The cored node of this input. |
| `slots` | `Record<string, CallableFunction>` | A record of slots that have been passed into the top level component responsible for creating the node. |
| `state` | `FormKitFrameworkContextState` | A collection of state trackers/details about the input |
| `type` | `string` | The type of input eg.  |
| `ui` | `Record<string, FormKitMessage>` | Translated ui messages that are not validation related. These are generally used for interface messages like  |
| `value` | `any` | The current committed value of the input. This is the value that should be used for most use cases. The setting of this property is debounced by the value of the debounce prop (default of 20ms). |

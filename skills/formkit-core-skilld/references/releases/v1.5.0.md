# 1.5.0

FormKit 1.5.0 ships with a new development build of FormKit. In development FormKit now uses slightly different versions of its packages that include additional developer experience enhancements. This is similar to how Vue itself has "development" and "production" versions, and it allows FormKit to provide an improved developer experience such as improved HMR support and better error messages.

The groundwork is now laid for greatly improved developer experience in future releases. This release also includes dozens of bug fixes and improvements.

###  New features

- Adds a new API for adding props to inputs with default values, boolean props, and getters/setters. See the updated docs for more info.
- `createInput` now supports a third argument, sectionsSchema which allows you to extend the default sections that come with `createInput` (#882).
- Adds new context property `didMount` and node event `mounted` to recognize when the `<FormKit>` component is mounted to the DOM (#0b8753d).
- Now `node.children` are observed by `@formkit/observer`, this allows validation rules to access `node.children` with reactivity.
- Hot module replacement with Vite/Nuxt now preserve the form state when updating form code (#1068)
- Adds new `changeLocale` composable that globally changes the locale of all forms with Options API, Composition API, and Nuxt autoimport (#1112)
- Rules `allow_non_alpha` and `allow_numeric`.
- The new FormKit cli now scaffolds new apps (`npx formkit create-app`) to use themes.formkit.com’s theme system.
- New development build of FormKit that includes additional developer experience enhancements.

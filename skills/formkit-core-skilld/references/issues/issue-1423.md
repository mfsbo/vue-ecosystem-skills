# Autocomplete single select should have an option of receiving the user's inputted text as a value, even if an option is not selected.

### Discussed in https://github.com/orgs/formkit/discussions/1422

<sup>Originally posted by **sebastian-eggers-pcg** June 20, 2024</sup>
Currently, Autocomplete always resets its value when the user starts typing and leaves the input without choosing a value.
In our usecase, we want to use Autocomplete only for suggestions, but also want to accept arbitrary inputs.
Is there an option for this (we did not find any), or can this somehow be solved somehow via an event callback or hook?</div>

I think it would also be fantastic if form validation could fully function with its entire range of features, such as live validation, etc. while the user types into the autocomplete field :)

**@lennarthendriksma-abovo**:

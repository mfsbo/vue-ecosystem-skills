# [Curreny] Option to hide the currency

### Discussed in https://github.com/orgs/formkit/discussions/1409

I know, it doesn't make sense to remove the currency from the currency input. But I really like the number formatting part of this component. In my project, I have currently have two currency components:
- One displaying a money value with the currency, using formkits currency component.
- One displaying a money value without the currency, using `vue-currency-input`.

It would be great if I can use formkits currency component for both cases.

If I omit the `currency` prop (or set it to undefined, it defaults to `usd`. Maybe a `false` value can be allowed, which hides the currency from the output?

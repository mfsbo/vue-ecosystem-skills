# Option to display step headers vertically on the **left side** of the  multi-step form

### Feature Request

I'd love to see an option to display step headers vertically on the **left side** of the 
multi-step form, rather than the default horizontal layout at the top.

### Why This Matters

- Improves UX for long forms by reducing vertical scroll
- Better suited for desktop layouts with wide screens
- Aligns with common UI patterns in enterprise apps and admin dashboards

### Suggested Implementation

- Add a `headerPosition="left"` or similar prop to `<FormKitMultiStep>`
- Allow styling overrides for vertical layout (e.g., flex column, scrollable sidebar)

### Bonus Points

If possible, support responsive behavior—vertical on desktop, horizontal on mobile.

Thanks for considering this enhancement!

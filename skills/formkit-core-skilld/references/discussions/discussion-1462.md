# How to get the Active Element inside a form?

Tried
```
import { useActiveElement } from '@vueuse/core'

const activeElement = useActiveElement()

watch(activeElement, (el) => {
  console.log('focus changed to', el.id)
})
```
But it's returning something like `input_232_3` instead of the name that corresponds to the form input.

Any idea?

# Datepicker: the format to display to the user in the select input is always in english even when the specified locale is "fr"

I'm using Formkit to create a datepicker input but the date format to display to the user in the select input is always in english (always DD/MM/YYYY instead of JJ/MM/AAAA) even when the specified locale is "fr". Is there a way to fix that?

Unfortunately there is not currently a way to change the placeholder tokens. Certainly something we can work on.

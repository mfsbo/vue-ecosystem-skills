Live Updates, also known as Over-the-Air (OTA) or hot code updates, are a way to push updates to your app without going through the app store review process. This is particularly useful for bug fixes or minor updates that don't require a full app release.

## Installation

To enable Live Updates in your Quasar Capacitor app, you need to install the `@capawesome/capacitor-live-update` plugin. First, navigate to your Capacitor project directory:

```bash
cd src-capacitor
```

Then, install the plugin:

```tabs
<<| bash Yarn |>>
$ yarn add @capawesome/capacitor-live-update
<<| bash NPM |>>
$ npm install --save @capawesome/capacitor-live-update
<<| bash PNPM |>>
$ pnpm add @capawesome/capacitor-live-update
<<| bash Bun |>>
$ bun add @capawesome/capacitor-live-update
```

After that, you need to sync the changes with your native projects:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

## Configuration

Next, you need to configure the plugin to work with Capawesome Cloud.

### App ID

In order for your app to identify itself to Capawesome Cloud, you need to set the `appId` in your `capacitor.config` file. For this, you need to create an app on the Capawesome Cloud Console and get the App ID.

```json /src-capacitor/capacitor.config file
{
  "plugins": {
    "LiveUpdate": {
      "appId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` with your actual App ID from the Capawesome Cloud Console.

After configuring the App ID, sync your Capacitor project again:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

## Usage

The most basic usage of the Live Update plugin is to call the `sync(...)` method when the app starts. This method checks for updates, downloads them if available, and sets them as the next bundle to be applied. You can then call the `reload()` method to apply the update immediately. If the `reload()` method is not called, the new bundle will be used on the next app start.

```js
import { LiveUpdate } from "@capawesome/capacitor-live-update"

const sync = async () => {
  const result = await LiveUpdate.sync()
  if (result.nextBundleId) {
    await LiveUpdate.reload()
  }
}
```

## Publishing updates

To publish your first update, you need to create a bundle on Capawesome Cloud. For this, you need a bundle artifact. A bundle artifact is the build output of your web app. In Quasar, this is the `src-capacitor/www` folder. You can create a bundle artifact by running the following command:

```bash
quasar build -m capacitor -T [android|ios]
```

This will create a `src-capacitor/www` folder with the build output of your web app. You can then upload this folder to Capawesome Cloud using the Capawesome CLI.
To install the Capawesome CLI, run the following command:

```tabs
<<| bash Yarn |>>
$ yarn global add @capawesome/cli
<<| bash NPM |>>
$ npm i -g @capawesome/cli
<<| bash PNPM |>>
$ pnpm add -g @capawesome/cli
<<| bash Bun |>>
$ bun install -g @capawesome/cli
```

After installing the Capawesome CLI, you need to log in to your Capawesome Cloud account. Run the following command and follow the instructions:

```bash
npx capawesome login
```

Once you are logged in, you can create a bundle by running the following command:

```bash
npx capawesome apps:bundles:create --path src-capacitor/www
```

Congratulations! You have successfully published your first live update. You can now test it by running your app on a device or emulator. The app will check for updates and apply them if available.
Feel free to check out the documentation of the Live Update plugin to see what else you can do with it.

# Improve .env File Handling

app-vite v2 and app-webpack v4 introduced a built-in `.env` file handling mechanism. It is a nice addition, but it comes with a few quirks that make it less useful (or even problematic) in certain cases. This issue serves as a central place to track discussions and improvements related to `.env` handling. Here are the main points:

1. **All `.env` variables are exposed by default** - #17914

   - Any variable you define in `.env` is automatically made available into the client-side app, which is considered a security risk.
   - It should only exposed if it follows a specific pattern like `QUASAR_`/`Q_CLI` or if explicitly defined to be exposed.

2. **`.env` variables are auto-converted into non-string types** - #17915

   - It auto-parses values like `"false"` into `false` for convenience, but this can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when using TypeScript.
   - `.env` values should **always** remain strings to match standard Node.js and dotenv behavior. This is important for consistency and to avoid confusion.
   - For convenience, flexibility, and increased distinction between statically replaced(_in client-side code_) and dynamic usage(_in Node based parts like SSR, Electron main process, etc._), we can introduce `import.meta.env` support. Then, use it for static replacements allowing multiple types, while keeping `process.env` for dynamic usage only string. This way, we can have the best of both worlds.

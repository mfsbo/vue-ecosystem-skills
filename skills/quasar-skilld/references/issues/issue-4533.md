# v1.0.0 stable has been released!

It's been a long time coming, and on behalf of the entire team and staff, I would just like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you for bearing with us, reporting issues and helping us make Quasar the # 1 framework for developing all the different kinds of Apps today's developers need.

Of course, we're not done yet. We plan on creating several new modes (browser-extensions, capacitor and webview) and doubling down on the quality and security of your projects.

We've created a newsletter mailing list that you can subscribe to at https://quasar.dev/newsletter - so sign up to keep abreast of the latest and greatest things in the Quasarverse. 

And if you are a Patreon supporter, don't forget to switch to GitHub sponsorship, because GitHub will match your donation: https://donate.quasar.dev

Finally, spread the word by retweeting this: https://twitter.com/quasarframework/status/1146371881727143936 and clapping for this: https://medium.com/quasar-framework/quasar-1-0-4bc696d60c1b

# [Feature Request] Multiple items per slide in carousel

It would be great to be able to have n items per slide in the carousel like in the "multiple items" section in Slick Carousel.

It would be a **double use case** (display multiple items and thumbnail carousel ) as I could turn it into a thumbnail carousel that would then display the selected image above the slider like Smart Slider 3 thus solving my current issue.

Having a thumbnail carousel in itself **could also be an additional feature**, but I thought it would be easiest to have multiple items in the carousel vs creating a new component for the current carousel.

Thank you for all the hard work put into Quasar!

Below are the example images so you don't have to go to the links above.

**Slick**


**Smart Slider 3**

# Memory Leak in PWA Mode Due to Deprecated Dependencies

### What happened?

**I'm using SSR + PWA mode.**

Running `npm install` in Quasar project with PWA enabled renders this warning message:

```bash
$ npm install
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated sourcemap-codec@1.4.8: Please use @jridgewell/sourcemap-codec instead
```

The major concern is the inflight@1.0.6 which leaks memory.

I also previously saw build (`npm run build`) failure with memory leak related error message, which is fixed now but I suspect the inflight@1.0.6 could be one of the cause.

### What did you expect to happen?

No warning message especially about memory leak.

### Reproduction URL

https://stackblitz.com/edit/quasarframework-stackblitz-templates-ealpqwif?file=package.json

### How to reproduce?

1. Create new project using Quasar CLI command `npm init quasar@latest`.
2. Enable PWA in **quasar.config.ts** file `pwa: true`.
3. Delete **node_modules** and **package-lock.json** file `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`.
4. Run `npm install`

### Flavour

Quasar CLI with Vite (@quasar/cli | @quasar/app-vite)

**@jasonwmatteson**:

Curious if there is any status on this?  I am using Quasar 2.18.6 and app-vite 2.4.0 and still get this same error on `npm install`.

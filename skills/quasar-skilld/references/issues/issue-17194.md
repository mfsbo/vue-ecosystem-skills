# Dialog component doesn't work with devtools

### What happened?


https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/assets/5583954/27ec89d3-d159-40dd-89e3-ca9106f0dbb4

When I click DialogComponent in dev tools I expect it to stay selected. Instead it's jumping back to original component (like on the video). Sometimes the Dialog data shows and stays on the right like now, but sometimes it's completely not working. Not sure why it's treated as a separate Vue instance.

### What did you expect to happen?

To behave like any other component so I can work with it.

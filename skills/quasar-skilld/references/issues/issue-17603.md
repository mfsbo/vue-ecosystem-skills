# q-tree with tickable nodes traps the keyboard

### What happened?

When a q-tree with any tick-strategy is present, it will not tab through the tickable boxes and in fact trap the keyboard.

### What did you expect to happen?

I would expect to be able to tab to each checkable item and check them, using the keyboard

### Reproduction URL

https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/blob/dev/docs/src/examples/QTree/TickStrategy.vue

### How to reproduce?

1. Go to the link, try to get focus in one of the checkboxes. try to escape by using tab. Notice how this is not working.

It is the same in the official docs

### Flavour

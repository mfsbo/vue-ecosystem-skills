# Vite 3/4/5 support for Quasar CLI with Vite

We already support Vite 3 for `@quasar/vite-plugin` starting from v3.1.0. We should support it in `@quasar/app-vite` too, preferably without user-facing breaking changes, just like we did in the Vite plugin.

https://vitejs.dev/guide/migration.html

We already weren't supporting Node 12, so that isn't a breaking change for us. I am not sure about the effect of the other changes, ATM.

There is a **temporary** workaround (until the Quasar CLI gets released with Vite 4):
Add the following to your `/package.json` (and use Yarn v1):

```
"resolutions": {
    "vite": "^4.0.0",
    "@vitejs/plugin-vue": "^4.0.0"
  }
```

Trying to release the new q/app CLI with Vite 4 in January/February -- upgrading Vite is easy, but I also want to add a big new feature which will require a lot of dev time. And also, I want to reduce the number of major versions for the CLI to be released because backporting fixes is a potential huge pain. So grouping multiple new stuff in a single bat...

**@IlCallo** [maintainer] (+11):

Adding up on the temporary workaround, note that if you're using vue-i18n you'll need to remove `@intlify/vite-plugin-vue-i18n` and replace it with `@intlify/unplugin-vue-i18n` to have Vite 4 support

**@domvie** (+19):

Is there any news on this or perhaps an ETA on when we can expect vite 3 support for `@quasar/app-vite`?

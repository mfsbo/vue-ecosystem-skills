# Incorrect behavior of QMenu in Firefox when it or its root element has 'display flex' with 'flex-direction: column' set

### What happened?

I noticed incorrect behavior on Mozilla Firefox Browser, when there is 'display flex' with 'flex-direction: column' set at root div or at component itself. It works in other browsers properly

q-menu div got appended to the body, but no positioning styles were applied



### What did you expect to happen?

QMenu should appear when clicking the button in the Mozilla browser

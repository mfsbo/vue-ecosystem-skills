# Adopt Material Design 3 specs



I'm sure you're tracking the pulse of follows Material Guidelines standards like me and others. That being said, material ui version 3 (Material You) is out.

We should track Quasar being migrated from Material Design v2 to Material Design version v3. I know maybe this will be very hard because even now there are still many components that do not use Material Guidelines standards (such as text field floating label outlined, etc)

I'm sure they'll be a few tickets that come out requesting adoption, so I figured this ticket could act as a stub and catch all for Quasar support for the design language's latest update.

Thanks

# Tailwind CSS v4 utilities overridden by Quasar component styles

### What happened?

When integrating Tailwind CSS v4 into a Quasar v2+ SPA, Quasar’s core component styles always win over my Tailwind utilities. For example:
```html
<q-card class="bg-red-900">
  
</q-card>
```
renders with a white background because Quasar ships:
```css
.q-card {
  background: white;
}
```
I don’t want to sprinkle !important or add custom selectors throughout a large project.

### What did you expect to happen?

The bg-red-900 utility should apply a red background to <q-card> without using !important.

### Reproduction URL

### Platforms/Browsers

**@timbze** (+4):

I've been extremely bugged with this same issue, but finally found a work-around.

Here's the main thing I do now.
In `main.ts`:
```ts
import './assets/first-imports.css'
// postcss-remove-declaration runs after first-imports are loaded, but before loading Tailwind css
import './assets/main.css'
```

first-imports.css
```css
/**
* Using this for postcss to be able to remove the conflicting classes from Quasar
* before importing Tailwind.
* We need to use layer for regular classes to work with Tailwind v4 which uses layers,
* so putting in css file instead of importing in main.ts so that we can use layer(base).
*/
@import 'quasar/dist/quasar.css' layer(base);
```...

**@FuelKubitox**:

I have exactly the same problem now. Wondering why this is not getting fixed. Seems like that only a few have that problem. And i dont understand the soltion from timbze. There is no main.ts file in my project. How can i affect the imports then?

# Remove all CSS generation and use CDN instead (or local pre-compiled copy)

I'd like to use a pre-compiled version of the quasar css (my own version of the quasar css files hosted on CDNs). I'm using the Quasar CLI version of quasar, so I just need all the css stuff turned off at dev time and build time, and just work off what I put in the index html file. How do I do that? I tried a number of things in quasar.config.ts, but it keeps injecting the css it seems.

check that repository as a example.

I'm overriding the css from `quasar/dist/quasar.sass` by my a custom css generated by the claude IA located at `./src/css/quasar-custom.scss`.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '#q-app/wrappers';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';

export default defineConfig((/* ctx */) => {
  return {
    build: {
      alias: {
        'quasar/dist/quasar.sass': fileURLToPath(
          new URL('./src/css/quasar-custom.scss', import.meta.url),
        ),
      },
    }
  }
})
```

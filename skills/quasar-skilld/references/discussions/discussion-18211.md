# Project Status & Roadmap Discussion: Community Perspective on Development Activity

## Opening Remarks

First and foremost, I want to express my deep appreciation for Quasar Framework. It's a truly excellent project that has proven invaluable to our development efforts over the years. The framework's comprehensive approach to building VueJS applications across multiple platforms is genuinely impressive, and we remain strong believers in its capabilities.

## Our Observation

As long-term users and sponsors of the Quasar project, we've been following the development closely. Over the past several months, we've noticed a gradual decline in development activity. While the framework continues to receive maintenance updates (which we greatly appreciate), the pace of new features, significant improvements, and strategic direction seems to have slowed considerably.

Additionally, we observed that the roadmap hasn't been updated in approximately a year, which makes it difficult for the community to understand the project's future direction and planned focus areas.

I fully understand that open source involves a huge amount of work, often for little reward and under a lot of pressure. It can be mentally challenging to keep going. I would therefore like to send my greetings, support...

+1, I’ve been feeling the same way.

I check the project almost every month hoping to see updates, but progress has been slowing down. The tech landscape, especially in 2025 moved very fast , and most major frameworks have received significant updates.

I really want to start using Quasar seriously for all my personal projects, but tbh, I’m hesitant to fully commit because I’m worried about investing a lot of time and then getting stuck later. Vue Vapor is coming soon and I’m excited about it, but realistically it doesn’t seem like it will land in Quasar anytime soon, assuming active devel...

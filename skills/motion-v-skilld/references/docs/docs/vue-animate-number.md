`AnimateNumber` creates beautiful number animations with Motion.

<AnimateNumber :value="count"/>

<AnimateNumber :value="count"/>

<AnimateNumber :value="count"/>

You can create a number of popular animation effects, like countdowns, engagement bars, or labelling user inputs.

It's a continuation of the original version of Max Barvian's NumberFlow component, which was built on Motion.

Because `AnimateNumber` leverages Motion's existing layout animations, it's only 3.6kb on top of Motion for Vue. It also means you can use Motion's existing transition settings.

However, being based on an older version of NumberFlow means it currently lacks a couple of its newer props like `trend` and `plugins`.

In this guide, we'll learn how to install `AnimateNumber` into our projects, and how to use it for a variety of number animation effects.

# useMotionValueEvent

`useMotionValueEvent` manages a motion value event handler throughout the lifecycle of a Vue component.



<template>
   <motion.div :style="{ x }" />
</template>

When the component is unmounted, event handlers will be safely cleaned up.

## [Usage](#usage)

Import from Motion:

import { useMotionValueEvent } from "motion-v"

To add an event listener to a motion value, provide the value, event name and callback:

const color = useMotionValue("#00f")

useMotionValueEvent(color, "change", (latest) => {
  console.log(latest)
})

Available events are:

- `change`
- `animationStart`
- `animationComplete`
- `animationCancel`

`"change"` events are provided the latest value of the motion value.

### [Advanced](#advanced)

`useMotionValueEvent` is a helper function for a motion value's `[on](https://motion.dev/vue-motion-value)` method. With `on`, you can start listening to events whenever you like, for instance within an event handler. But remember to also unsubscribe when the component unmounts.

watch([x, y],(n,o,onCleanUp) => {
  const doSomething = () => {}
  
  const unsubX = x.on("change", doSomething)
  const unsubY = y.on("change", doSomething)
  
  onCleanUp(() => {
    unsubX()
    unsubY()
  })
},{
  immediate:true
})

# MotionConfig

The `MotionConfig` component can be used to set configuration options for all child `[motion](https://motion.dev/vue-motion-component)` components.



<template>
  <MotionConfig :transition="{ duration: 1 }">
    <motion.div
        :initial="{ opacity: 0 }"
        :animate="{ opacity: 1 }"
      />
  </MotionConfig>
</template>

## [Props](#props)

### [`transition`](#transition)

Define a fallback `transition` to use for all child `motion` components.

### [`reducedMotion`](#reducedmotion)

**Default:** `"never"`

`reducedMotion` lets you set a site-wide policy for handling reduced motion. It offers the following options:

- `"user"`: Respect the user's device setting.
- `"always"`: Enforce reduced motion (useful for debugging).
- `"never"`: Don't respect reduced motion.

When reduced motion is on, transform and layout animations will be disabled. Other animations, like `opacity` and `backgroundColor`, will persist.

### [`nonce`](#nonce)

If using a Content Security Policy with a `nonce` attribute, passing the same attribute through `MotionConfig` will allow any `style` blocks generated by Motion to adhere the the security policy.

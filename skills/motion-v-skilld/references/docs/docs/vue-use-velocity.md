# useVelocity

`useVelocity` accepts a motion value and returns a new one that updates with the provided motion value's velocity.



<template>
  <Motion drag="x" :style="{ x, scale }" />
</template>

## [Usage](#usage)

Import `useVelocity` from Motion:

import { useVelocity } from "motion-v"

Pass any numerical motion value to `useVelocity`. It'll return a new motion value that updates with the velocity of the original value.



<template>
  <Motion :style="{ x }" />
</template>

Any numerical motion value will work. Even one returned from `useVelocity`.

const x = useMotionValue(0)
const xVelocity = useVelocity(x)
const xAcceleration = useVelocity(xVelocity)

# Presets

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Alot of times website use simple `opacity` fade-in-out effects and it can be a bit repetitive writing motion with exact same effect through out.
 
**Describe the solution you'd like**
1. Ready made motion presets used as directive `preset=fade-in` like in `vueuse/motion`.
2. Ability to create reusable custom presets.

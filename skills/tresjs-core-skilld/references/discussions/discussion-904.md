# How can I create an html box that is facing the camera at specific coordinates?

I drew devices with status information on the map, and I want to see these statuses right away.
 I want to create an html box at the coordinates of the device, draw a table there, and show it to the camera, but I don't know how to do it.
I desperately need help...

Very old one but I think using html component will do it

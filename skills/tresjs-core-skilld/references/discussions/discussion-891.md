# How to use PointsMaterial in TresJs?

I thought with the naming convention its just `<TresMeshPointsMaterial  />` but that doesnt work. Does it exist under a different name? Any help is much appreciated.

Hi @schachmatthias ,

Try `<TresPointsMaterial />`.

We don't provide support here, but if you need further help, you can ask over on the Discord. It's usually faster.

# Enable scroll on Touch Devices

Hello,

how can I enable scrolling on touch devices?
On the canvas is a style attribute "touch-action: none;" which prevents from scrolling over the canvas.
I do not need any touch actions on the canvas like the orbitcontrols or so.
I tried already to set `<TresCanvas style="touch-action: auto">` but that doesn't work.

Thank you

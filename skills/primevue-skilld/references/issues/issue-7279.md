# primevue.org Website - Navigation Broken

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Navigate to primevue.org.
2. Attempt to navigate to any section of the website *other than* by clicking on a navigation link (e.g., try clicking on a component such as the components dropdown).


**Environment:**

* **Browser:** Chrome Version 132.0.6834.83
* **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS

The problem seems to occur on browsers using chromium (it works on Firefox)

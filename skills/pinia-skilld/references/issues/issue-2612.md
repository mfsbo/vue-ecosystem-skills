# Pinia Eslint plugin

### What problem is this solving

Would be cool to have an Eslint plugin that provides best practices. E.g. With a setup store all variables need to be exported (according to the docs) and a plugin could warn / error if we forgot to export a variable / function.

Maybe there are more best practices or anti patterns that the plugin could warn / error about.

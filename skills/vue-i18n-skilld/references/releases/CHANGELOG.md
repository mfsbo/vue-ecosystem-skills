## What's Changed

### Deprecate Legacy API mode

The Legacy API mode was the API mode compatible with v8 for Vue 2. When v9 was released, the Legacy API was provided to smooth the migration from v8 to v9.

Legacy API mode will be deprecated in v11, as previous vue-i18n releases have already provided the following to support migration to Composition API mode

- Migration from Legacy API mode to Composition API mode, see the docs
- Composition API usage, see the docs

For compatibility, Legacy API mode still works in v11, but will be removed entirely in v12, so Legacy API mode will not work after that version.

### Deprecate Custom Directive `v-t`

The advantage of `v-t` was that it could optimize performance using the vue compiler transform and the pre-translation of `vue-i18n-extension`.

This feature was supported from Vue 2.
About details see the blog article

In Vue 3, due to the Composition API, the pre-translation of `vue-i18n-extension` is now limited only for global scope.

In addition, Vue 3 Virtual DOM optimization has been introduced, and the optimization provided by `vue-i18n-extension` is no longer very effective. We need to require settings for SSR, the benefits of using `v-t` have disappeared. And DX of templates using `v-t` is not good. Custom directives do not work with key completion in editors (e.g. vscode).

For compatibility, `v-t` mode still works in v11, but will be removed entirely in v12, so `v-t` will not work after that version.

### Drop `tc` and `$tc` for Legacy API mode

These APIs had already deprecated in warning about being dropped in v11. docs says

### Vue I18n maintenance Status

Vue I18n v8 is no longer supported after 2025. Vue I18n v9 and Vue I18n v10 is in maintenance mode after 2025 July.

With the release of Vue I18n v11, that version will become mainstream.

The maintenance detail status of Vue I18n v9 and Vue I18n v10 is as follows:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intlify/vue-i18n/master/docs/public/lifecycle2025.svg" />

# v10.0.0 (2024-09-10T04:41:41Z)

We are excited to announce the release of Vue I18n v10.
We had many contributors.

Thanks for your contributing 

# Summary

## `petite-vue-i18n` General Availability

`petite-vue-i18n` is an alternative distribution of Vue I18n, providing only minimal features.

If you don't need the full functionality of vue-i18n and are just looking for basic translation features with a smaller footprint, this will suit your use case.

For more details, please see the docs.

## JIT Compilation Enabled by Default

JIT compilation was introduced in v9.3, but it was not enabled by default.

However, it had the following issues:

- CSP restrictions: Difficult to work with service/web workers, edge-side runtimes of CDNs, etc.
- Backend integration: Hard to fetch messages from a backend (e.g., a database via API) and localize them dynamically.

Starting from v10, JIT compilation is enabled by default.

## Support for Generated Locale Types

We provide an interface to extend the Locale type in TypeScript, similar to `ComponentCustomProperties` in Vue.

This feature is useful when using vue-i18n as part of a framework.

For more details, see the PR for the Nuxt I18n use case.

## Changes to `$t` and `t` Overload Signatures for Legacy API Mode

In Vue I18n v9, `$t` and `t` had different overload signatures in Composition API mode compared to Legacy API mode.

When migrating from Legacy API mode to Composition API mode, these differences sometimes caused confusion.

Starting from v10, Legacy API mode will use the same `$t` and `t` overload signatures as Composition API mode.

For details on the signature pattern, see the migration guide.

## Deprecation of `tc` and `$tc` for Legacy API Mode

The `t` and `$t` functions already support pluralization, so `tc` and `$tc` can be replaced.

In v10, `tc` and `$tc` still exist to aid in migration, but they will be fully removed in v11.

If you use them, Vue I18n will display a console warning in your application.

For migration instructions, see the docs.

## Dropping Deprecated Features from v9

Some features were marked as deprecated in v9 with warnings.

These deprecated features will be completely removed in v10.

For more details on the deprecated features, see the docs.

# v9.3.0 (2023-09-05T08:39:25Z)

We are excited to announce the release of Vue I18n v9.3, finally !! This release includes some new features, bug fixes, improvements, and document fixes.

We had commited with 37 contributors. Thanks for your contributing 

In the following, we introduce some of the new features:

##  Features

### Node.js Dual packages (`cjs` / `mjs`)

We provide CommonJS and Native ESM dual module packages for Node.js. This supports both `require` and `import` for loading modules in Node.js.

- feat: cjs/mjs file extension fully by @kazupon in https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next/pull/1147
- feat: support ESM file extension by @kazupon in https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next/pull/1137
- feat: node esm for message compiler by @kazupon in https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next/pull/1460

### JIT Style Compilation

Supports JIT (Just In Time) style compilation of message formats. **This mean, removes the CSP limitation and allows for use in environments such as Service worker, Web worker, and Edge.**

It mean also now supports the use-case where locale messages are **dynamically retrieved from the backend via the API.**

For more information, please see the docs

The performance of JIT-style compilation is close to that of conventional AOT (Ahead Of Time) style compilation, and you can improve the performance to nearly **3x** with combination of JIT + AOT.

Below are the compile performance benchmark results for vue-i18n:

```sh
> node ./benchmark/index.mjs

compilation:

compile simple message x 396,898 ops/sec ±0.31% (98 runs sampled)
compile complex message x 60,036 ops/sec ±0.34% (99 runs sampled)

simple pattern on 1000 resources (AOT):

resolve time with core x 279,919 ops/sec ±0.19% (99 runs sampled)
resolve time on composition x 93,963 ops/sec ±0.48% (93 runs sampled)
resolve time on composition with compile cache x 230,928 ops/sec ±0.20% (100 runs sampled)

simple pattern on 1000 resources (JIT):

resolve time with core x 277,813 ops/sec ±0.18% (99 runs sampled)
resolve time on composition x 91,959 ops/sec ±0.43% (97 runs sampled)
resolve time on composition with compile cache x 227,117 ops/sec ±0.15% (99 runs sampled)

simple pattern on 1000 resources (JIT + AOT):

resolve time with core x 319,061 ops/sec ±0.18% (100 runs sampled)
resolve time on composition x 204,529 ops/sec ±0.22% (95 runs sampled)
resolve time on composition with compile cache x 204,652 ops/sec ±0.30% (100 runs sampled)

complex pattern on 1000 resources (AOT):

resolve time with core x 240,427 ops/sec ±0.37% (100 runs sampled)
resolve time on composition x 33,959 ops/sec ±0.45% (94 runs sampled)
resolve time on composition with compile cache x 200,980 ops/sec ±0.15% (99 runs sampled)

complex pattern on 1000 resources (JIT):

resolve time with core x 225,739 ops/sec ±0.25% (99 runs sampled)
resolve time on composition x 36,379 ops/sec ±0.49% (97 runs sampled)
resolve time on composition with compile cache x 191,653 ops/sec ±0.24% (100 runs sampled)

complex pattern on 1000 resources (JIT + AOT):

resolve time with core x 278,542 ops/sec ±0.20% (98 runs sampled)
resolve time on composition x 92,781 ops/sec ±0.31% (98 runs sampled)
resolve time on composition with compile cache x 92,865 ops/sec ±0.33% (98 runs sampled)
```

You can clone Vue I18n and run the benchmark with `pnpm build:type && pnpm benchmark` to check.

- feat: support JIT like compilation by @kazupon in https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next/pull/1434
- feat: support AST minification by @kazupon in https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next/pull/1474

### Custome message format

Starting with v9.3, Vue I18n will give message format customization as an experimental feature. This will allow for extending to the message format:

```js
import { createI18n } from 'vue-i18n'
import { messageCompiler } from './compilation'

const i18n = createI18n({
  legacy: false,
  locale: 'en',
  messageCompiler,
  messages: {
    en: {
      hello: 'hello world!',
      greeting: 'hi, {name}!',
      photo: `You have {numPhotos, plural,
        =0 {no photos.}
        =1 {one photo.}
        other {# photos.}
      }`
    }
  }
})
```

About details, please see the docs

- feat: support custom message format with `messageCompiler` option by @kazupon in https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next/pull/1497
- perf: support drop message compiler feature flag by @kazupon in https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next/pull/1510

### Exports type definition and API

Export `v-t` type definitions and API `$te` to support Vue I18n extending for third vendors and your Vue applications.

- feat: export `v-t` directive type by @kazupon in https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next/pull/1511
- feat: export `$te` as global on composition mode by @kazupon in https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next/pull/1222

##  Important Changes: 1

### `allowComposition` option

The `allowComposition` option will be removed in Vue I18n v10. We have accordingly output a warning if you are using it.

If you are using Vue I18n Legacy API to migrate to the Composition API, please make sure you have done so with the Vue I18n v9 version.

- fix: prepare to drop `allowComposition` option by @kazupon in https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next/pull/1496

### Deprecate vue-i18n official bundle plugins

The following plugin or loader for bundler is deprecated because it can be replaced by the `unplugin-vue-i18n`.

- `rollup-plugin-vue-i18n`
- `vite-plugin-vue-i18n`
- `vue-i18n-loader`

These will only be taken as hot fixes in the future, and no additional functionality will be added.

## v9.2.0 (2022-08-01)

We are excited to announce the release of Vue I18n v9.2 !! This release includes many new features, bug fixes, improvements, and document fixes.

We had commited with 35 contributors. Thanks for your contributing 

In the following, we introduce some of the new features:

### More TypeScript supporting

From Vue I18n v9.2, we have improved TypeScript support. This allows type checking of resources specified in the `messages` option of `createI18n` and complementing with APIs such as `t`.

The following images is the resoureces type-checked:




The following gif image is the API completion working:



For more information on how to setup the system, please read the docs

### Web Components

WebComponents has been supported since Vue 3.2. You can support your Vue Component with Vue I18n as well.

About details, See more the docs

### Small size subset of Vue I18n

We have released `petite-vue-i18n`, a small size subset version of Vue I18n, as an experimental feature.

Only minimal functionality is provided in this module. you can reduce your Vue application bundle size with using this module. If you do not need to use all the features of Vue I18n, this module would be a good option.

About details, See more README

### Bridging to Vue 3

We have released a module called `vue-i18n-bridge` to support Vue 2 applications with Vue I18n v8.x migrate to Vue 3.

`vue-i18n-bridge` is a module that is mostly compatible with the Vue I18n v9 API. It's an add-on to existing Vue I18n v8.26.1 or later + Vue 2 applications to take advantage of the Composition API provided in Vue I18n v9. This module would be able to support the progressive migration to Vue 3.

About details, See more the docs

### `globalInjection` option **As default**

From Vue I18n v9.2, the `globalInjection` option defaults to `true`. If you localize by global scope using `$t` in your template, you no longer need to set this option.

### `useI18n` in Legacy API mode

We have supported for `useI18n` in Legacy API mode. This feature would be useful if you want to migrate from the options API style to the Composition API style in your Vue 3 application.

About details, See more the docs

### Vue 2.7

`vue-i18n-bridge` module for migration to Vue 3 of course supports Vue 2.7.

Instead of going from Vue 2.6 to Vue 3 directly, you can migrate your Vue applications using Vue I18n with a strategy of Vue 2.6, Vue 2.7, and then Vue 3 progressively.

### SSR for `v-t`

We have supported SSR for `v-t`. If your Vue application uses `v-t`, you can support SSR without having to be aware in your Vue application.

To provide experimental features for `@intlify/devtools`, feature flags have been separated as follows.

- `__VUE_I18N_PROD_DEVTOOLS__`: enable/disable vue-devtools support in production, default: false
- `__INTLIFY_PROD_DEVTOOLS__`: enable/disable `@intlify/devtools` support in production, default: false

Previously, `__INTLIFY_PROD_DEVTOOLS__` setting flagged the use of both vue-devtools and `@intlify/devtools` in production.

In later v9.1, The feature flags for vue-devtools are now enabled/disabled by setting `__VUE_I18N_PROD_DEVTOOLS__`.

## v9.0.0-alpha.1 (2020-04-07)

### :star: New Features

#### Composable API

New style API for Vue 3. See the following docs:

- createI18nComposer
- I18nComposerOptions
- I18nComposer
- useI18n

### :lollipop: Examples

See the `examples` directory.

The examples are offered that use the following two API styles:

- composable
  - new vue-i18n API optimized for Vue 3. details about API
- legacy
  - vue-i18n API almost compatible with vue-i18n v8.x

### :heavy_exclamation_mark: Known issues

#### :boom: Breaking changes compared to vue-i18n v8.x

- API
  - The return value of `$t` and `t` methods is **string** only. object and array values are no longer returned.
  - The return value of `$tc` and `tc` methods is **string** only. object and array values are no longer returned.
  - `VueI18n` class cannot used with `new`. It can only be used via the `$i18n` property of Vue instance.
    - In vue-i18n-next, by replacing `new VueI18n` with `createI18n`, you can use existing `VueI18n` options as they are.
    - See the `examples/legacy` directory.
  - `VueI18n.prototype.getChoiceIndex`
    - -> Legacy API style: `pluralizationRules` option of `createI18n` factory function (like `new VueI18n(...)`)
    - -> Compsable API style: `pluralRules` option of `createI18nComposer` facatory function
  - `VueI18n.version` -> `import { VERSION } from 'vue-i18n'`
  - `VueI18n.availabilities` -> `import { availabilities } from 'vue-i18n'`
  - See the details here

#### :zap: Improvements

- See the vue-i18n issues that labeld with `Status: Ready`

#### :hammer: Missing features

- imporve `fallbackLocale` or `fallbackLocales` (related vue-i18n issue)
- `<i18n>` custom block supporting for SFC
- `v-t` directive
- `preserveDirectiveContent` option (depend on `v-t`)
- Compoonent interpolation with `<i18n>` component
- Number custom formatting with `<i18n-n>` component
- HTML format suppression with `warnHtmlInMessage` option
- SSR
- Custom formatting
- Tooling
  - `vue-cli-plugin-i18n`
  - `@intlify/vue-i18n-loader`
  - `@intlify/rollup-plugin-vue-i18n`
  - `@intlify/vue-i18n-extensions`
  - `@intlify/eslint-plugin-vue-i18n`

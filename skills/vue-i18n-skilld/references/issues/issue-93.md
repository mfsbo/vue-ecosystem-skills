# Use `@formatjs/intl`?

 We just released `@formatjs/intl` that detaches the imperative API from the React binding (react-intl uses this basically) so I'm curious if vue-i18n-next can use it? It basically has everything that react-intl supports (custom formats, default timeZone, format merging, handling AST vs regular messages).

I'm curious what the roadmap for vue-i18n-next is as well?

No hard feelings if this doesn't happen

# Mark popper.js deprecated

**Describe the bug**

You could please make popper.js npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@popperjs/core deprecated and point to floating-ui instead?

**Expected behavior** 

I expect popper.js be marked deprecated with a message pointing to the new replacement floating-ui.


**Additional context** 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@popperjs/core

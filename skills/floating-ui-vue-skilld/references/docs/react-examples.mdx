## Base UI

Base UI is a
new component library built with `@floating-ui/react`, developed
by one of its authors. It offers a set of pre-built components,
including Tooltip, Popover, Dropdown Menu, Select, and Dialog.

- Base UI Tooltip
- Base UI Popover
- Base UI Menu
- Base UI Select
- Base UI Dialog
- Base UI Preview Card
- Base UI Alert Dialog
- Base UI Toast

These are highly polished, production-ready components.

## Raw Floating UI

Base UI doesn't have all components you'll need yet, such as
Combobox. The following guides can help you learn how to build
using `@floating-ui/react` alone to create more advanced
components yourself:

- [Tooltip guide](/docs/tooltip)
- [Popover guide](/docs/popover)
- [Dialog guide](/docs/dialog)

## CodeSandbox Examples

More advanced examples are available via a CodeSandbox demo.
These are experimental examples that aren't fully polished and
may require further refinement for production use.

- Dropdown Menu (including submenus)
- Context Menu
- Select
- Select with Composable Children
- Virtualized Select
- Autocomplete (combobox)
- Emoji picker
- Text selection

# [Bug Report][3.6.7] Infinite-Scroll load-event not fired after reseting Filter

### Environment
**Vuetify Version:** 3.6.7
**Vue Version:** 3.4.27
**Browsers:** Chrome 124.0.0.0
**OS:** Windows 10

### Steps to reproduce
When you scroll down the list it'll be extended by names randomly which are in an array called 'names'. If you type in a name in the text-field "Search" which is available in the array 'names' like 'Max' it also works fine. If you type in a name which isn't available like 'Lisa' it says 'no more' which is okay because done('empty') gets called. But if you delete the name in "Search" now the load-event doesn't get called anymore even if there are potential entries available.

### Expected Behavior
the load-event should be called again.

### Actual Behavior
the load-event isn't called because done('empty') prevents it

### Other comments
Maybe there is an extra status needed. For that use-case a person wants to filter something.

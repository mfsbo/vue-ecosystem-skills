# Material Design 3 (Material You)

https://m3.material.io/

As the specification is not complete yet, I propose the following changes for vuetify 3 with the rest coming in a future version:
- Update theme colors to match https://m3.material.io/styles/color/the-color-system/tokens
- Adaptive typography: https://m3.material.io/styles/typography/overview
- Update variant names to match https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview
  - `elevated`, `filled`, `tonal`, `outlined`, `text`
- Update state layers https://m3.material.io/foundations/interaction-states

I'm pretty sure that we support everything in MD3 and then some; we support concepts and components from MD1 that no longer exist.

Yes, it is supported by way of blueprints: https://next.vuetifyjs.com/en/features/blueprints/

Right now they are limited to configuration through props only but we plan to expand that to include SCSS variables in the future.

The Material 3 spec was incomplete and not ready for general use, but Google seems to have published an update in the last few weeks that mostly completes their component collection. A Vuetify blueprint might work in some cases, but there are several incompatibilities around typography and component states between M2 and M3, so a blueprint will only give you an approximation for how an M3 component would look like and behave, unless some components are redesigned with the new spec in mind.

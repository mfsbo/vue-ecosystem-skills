# [Feature Request] Export TS types, interfaces

### Problem to solve
Let's consider next struct
```
const headers: DataTableHeader[] = [
  { title: '#', key: 'id' },
  { title: t('messages.name'), key: 'name' },
  { title: t('messages.lat'), key: 'lat' },
  { title: t('messages.lng'), key: 'lng' },
  { title: t('messages.state'), key: 'state', value: 'state.name', sortable: false },
  { title: t('messages.country'), key: 'country', value: 'state.country.name', sortable: false },
]
if(can('upsert', 'city')) {
  headers.push({ title: t('messages.actions'), key: 'action', sortable: false, align: 'end' })
}
```

We as developers don't have access to defined types, interfaces as a result in my project I have to duplicate the same TS types

### Proposed solution
Just add export to types, interfaces that you already defined

@websitevirtuoso I agree this should be done, i did find a workaround for now though:
```
import { VDataTable } from 'vuetify/lib/labs/components'
export type VDataTableHeaderProps = Extract<
  VDataTable['$props']['headers'][number],
  DataTableHeader[]
>[number]
```

I do get a somewhat misleading typescript error for unresolved type on DataTableHeader but it does in fact still work.

**@aentwist** (+2):

This is very specifically about Labs, right? There is currently nothing to export anything other than the components.

Edit: I see the `Anchor` issue. Looks like this issue is being purposed for all of Vuetify

**@felicienfrancois** (+1):

@joel-wenzel a simpler variant with no typescript error
```typescript
import { VDataTable } from 'vuetify/labs/VDataTable';
export type VDataTableHeaderProps = Extract<VDataTable['$props']['headers'][number], {key: string}>
```

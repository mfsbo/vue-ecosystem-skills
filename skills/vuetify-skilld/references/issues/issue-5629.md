# [Bug Report] add keyboard controls to v-datepicker

### Problem to solve
Currently user's need to use the mouse to select date. Which is not very quick and efficient.

### Proposed solution
Use the arrow keys to move around the calendar when it is open. Press enter to select the date the user has currently selected.

May sound outdated but we also have a need for this feature, we have forms to be filled repeatedly and some users prefer using keyboard only.

I've changed this issue to refer only to datepicker and created a separate issue for time picker

Yes, planned for 3.0, nothing set in stone though

# The future of Vuetify

## The beginning
When I created Vuetify, it was a personal project meant to help spec out prototypes more efficiently. Only after sharing it with a co-worker was I convinced to release it as an full open-source project. The amazing community and extremely talented developers that I have had the pleasure to be around are what make working on this project mean so much to me. But you cannot have the sweet without the sour. Maintaining the level of activity needed to accommodate the growing needs of the user-base has lead to many sleepless nights and time away from my family.

## The transition
With **v1.0** around the corner, the pressure is on and has no signs of letting up. After talking with my current employer, we both agree that this is a dream that should not be passed up. Starting on **November 1st**, I will officially transition my day job to Vuetify. Providing the best possible quality for developers and enterprise users will only be possible if I dedicate 100% of my time to building out the Vue and Vuetify ecosystem. I want to give developers and businesses from around the world a platform that they can use to succeed.

## The future
If this project has enabled you or your organization to do great things, I'm calling for your support. In the coming months I will be expanding the reach of Vuetify's community and support network by working with project backers and community members to help fine-tune the underdeveloped areas of the framework. The documentation will be updated with new guides, better examples, more resources and better i18n support.

Brilliant news, John! And I hope this will last for a long, long time in order to have a reliable framework that's going to stay. To have this commitment and view of the future is a very important point to convice bosses using open source like Vuetify. Thanky you very much!

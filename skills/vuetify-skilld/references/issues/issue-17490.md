# [Feature Request] Support nuxt prop for Vuetify 3 on Routable components

### Problem to solve
In Vuetify2 adding the `nuxt` to a routable component (e.g. `v-btn` or `v-card`) produced a `nuxt-link` if `to` prop or `href` prop was passed. In Vuetify 3 the `nuxt` prop does no longer exist.

### Proposed solution

Without `nuxt` prop:
`<v-btn href="https://vuetifyjs.com"/>` => `<a href="https://vuetifyjs.com"/>`
`<v-btn to="/vuetify"/>` => `<router-link to="/vuetify"/>`
`<v-btn />` => `<button />` (No `href` or `to`)

With `nuxt` prop:
`<v-btn nuxt href="https://vuetifyjs.com"/>` => `<nuxt-link href="https://vuetifyjs.com"/>`
`<v-btn nuxt to="/vuetify"/>` => `<nuxt-link to="/vuetify"/>`
`<v-btn nuxt />` => `<button  />`  (No `href` or `to`)

NOTE: `nuxt-link` can now handle internal (`to`) and external (`href`) links:  https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-link

Hi  @KaelWD, I have raised an issue in nuxt repo: nuxt/nuxt#22169. Will vuetify team implement this feature once `useLink` function is added to `NuxtLink`? If not, how to implement this feature?

**@LittleSheep2Code** (+1):

I noticed the button and others components use render function like way to render, we can use custom tag property to implement this feature, but will get a typescript error because the tag property doesn't accept vue component type.

The code will like this:

```vue
<v-btn :tag="RouterLink" to="/">Link</v-btn>
```

I didn't find way to directly use the NuxtLink component in code, so I made a wrapper of NuxtLink. That is the RouterLink refere...

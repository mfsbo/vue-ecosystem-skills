# Documentation using modules

Right now the starting guide (https:/router.vuejs.org/guide/) still uses a vanilla index.html approach. I think that it was easier back when vue-router started but now it isn't anymore and that maybe that page should be updated using .vue components and pointing to vue CLI and vite. It should maybe also point to Vue docs explaining Vue files.

What are your thoughts on this?

Do you have any other ideas on how to restructure this section of the docs?

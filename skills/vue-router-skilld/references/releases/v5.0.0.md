# v5.0.0

Vue Router 5 is a _boring_ release, it merges unplugin-vue-router into the core package with no breaking changes. The only exception is that the _iife_ build no longer includes `@vue/devtools-api` because it has been upgraded to v8 and does not expose an IIFE build itself. You can track that change in this issue. See the migration guide for instructions on how to upgrade from unplugin-vue-router to Vue Router 5.

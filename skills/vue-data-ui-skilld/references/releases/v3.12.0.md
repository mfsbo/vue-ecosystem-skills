# v3.12.0

## Built-in annotator

- Prevent scroll on touch screens when drawing lines
- Add new annotation modes:
  - straight line with arrowhead
  - straight line

The mode button now starts from the straight line + arrowhead and cycles as such:

straight line  + arrow -> text -> straight line -> freehand line

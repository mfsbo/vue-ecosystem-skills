# v3.13.4

A config attribute was added to control the max width of the zoom component in the following charts:

- VueUiXy
- VueUiXyCanvas
- VueUiQuickChart
- VueUiDonutEvolution
- VueUiStackbar
- VueUiStackline
- VueUiCandlestick

`zoom.maxWidth` (number | null) is set to null by default (previous behavior, the components takes 100% of the available width)

# [FEATURE REQUEST] Improve default theme/dark mode support

We recently switched from vue3-apexcharts: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/developer-relations/contributor-success/contributors-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/1445

Thank you for all your amazing support already!

We were surprised we needed to configure as much theming/styling and implement light/dark mode detection: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/developer-relations/contributor-success/contributors-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/contributors/app/javascript/pages/dashboard-page/chartConfig.js

It feels like we might have missed something.

Should it be possible to leverage vue-data-ui without setting up the basic styling/theme and automatic dark mode handling?

Thanks

# [FEATURE REQUEST] VueUiHorizontalBar: Data label formatter and persistent axes/grid

Hello,

I would like to ask whether it is possible to customize the data label formatter.

Specifically, when a data label is too long, I would like to:

- wrap the text onto a new line, or
- truncate the text and display the full value on hover (tooltip)
<img width="548" height="167" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1afffa5-6435-4b87-87cd-261e700ea3f4" />

Additionally, is it possible to display grid lines or X/Y axes similar to a stacked bar chart?
This would make the chart easier to read.

Finally, I would like to know if the axes or grid can still be displayed even when there is no data, so the chart does not appear completely empty.

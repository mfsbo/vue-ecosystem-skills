# Link previews

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

It is not related to a direct problem that I have but instead a feature that I would be a great addition to the overall documentation experience that Vitepress provides,

### Describe the solution you'd like

It would be great if the links that we embed into a page would have some kind of preview popup that gets displayed to the user via the use of an iframe or simply using the open graph protocol. Similar to what Trello does here 
<img width="617" alt="image" src="https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/assets/26552540/8c86f966-1edb-4ac6-8fe4-8cd17e7a5467">
 As you can see, when I hover over the link a preview is displayed to the user with information regarding the link, it could be through an iframe open graph or both.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

I have not considered any alternatives because I believe that non exist that fulfil the idea that I have in mind

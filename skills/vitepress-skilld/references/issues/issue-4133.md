**@enzonotario** (+16):

I'm working in a Theme for this. There's still a lot to improve, and I'm eager to learn and make it better: https://github.com/enzonotario/vitepress-openapi

**@brc-dd** [maintainer] (+1):

I think the plugin Enzo mentioned above works good. If you think some features are missing or something is broken, try sending PRs, and creating and helping with issues there. And if it works for you, please consider sponsoring him and star the repo.

I'm closing this as I don't think it needs to be there in core. Other frameworks also only have third-party plugins.

To Enzo, maybe release a stable version. It's been in alpha for nearly an year.

Ok, I finally released v0.1.0! 
Thank you so much for your support and for pushing this forward!

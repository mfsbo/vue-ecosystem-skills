# feat: changeable entry file

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Vitepress defaults to `index.md` as the entry file. GitHub defaults to `README.md`/`readme.md` as the entry file for the directory, and I would like my repo and site to be consistent.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
An `entry` config that defaults to `index.md` but can be changed to `readme.md`

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

**Additional context**

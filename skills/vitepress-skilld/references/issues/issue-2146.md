# Auto expand/collapse sections in page outline

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Deeply nested content on a page is hard to navigate if everything is expanded in the "On this page" outline section.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Expand the child headings only when the parent heading is selected and collapse them when focus shifts to another heading.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

_No response_

### Additional context

Left most is the current behavior and the other two show the desired behavior.

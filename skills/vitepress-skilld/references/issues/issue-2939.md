# Dynamic routes/pages not visible in `local` search

### Describe the bug

Dynamic routes/pages are not visible with the `local` search.
Is there any way to manually add dynamic content to be searchable?

### Reproduction

Similar setup as in documentation: https://vitepress.dev/guide/routing#dynamic-routes

Search finds dynamic generated pages.

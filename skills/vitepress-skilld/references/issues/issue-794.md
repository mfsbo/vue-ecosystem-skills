# Add "Index Page" feature

It would be great to have index page where it lists all subpage headings like Vue.js API page.

This feature would be especially useful for pages like API and config references. The idea is to fetch crawl pages based on sidebar menu structure, and list all headings with in the page, separating them into each section (box in Vue.js API example).

Not 100% sure how Vue.js website is doing this at the moment, but we should first come up with good API design (how to configure this page).

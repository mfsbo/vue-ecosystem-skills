# Add examples

As mentioned in #253, we probably should add a community examples page. Here are the things that we can add:

- Markdown Extensions
  * Code Groups
  * Footnotes
  * Task Lists
  * Maths, Diagrams, Charts

- SEO Improvement
  * Sitemaps
  * Meta Tags

- Image Extensions
  * Zoom on Click
  * Image Gallary
  * Figures and Captions

- Complex Use-Cases
  * Building PWA
  * CSS Isolation
  * Dynamic Sidebar
  * Multiple Bases
  * Offline Search
  * Writing Blogs
  * Versioning

- Integration with other libraries:
  * TailwindCSS
  * Styleguidist (might be tricky)
  * Pinia

I created this list based on popular VuePress plugins and VitePress issues. Having such a page before v1 will significantly ease up migration. If you think the list is missing something common then please comment.

Some of these can be officially supported too, especially the markdown extensions.

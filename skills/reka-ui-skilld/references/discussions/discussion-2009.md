# Browsers support

Hello. I'm trying to realise which browsers are supported, but can't find this information. Is it available somewhere? For example, I found a potential bug with animations in Safari 15.0 (`Object.hasOwn` appeared from 15.4), but I'm not sure if it's a bug in the Reka UI or if the browser is too old.

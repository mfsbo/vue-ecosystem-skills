# Custom NavigationMenuRoot aria-label ?

Is there a way to set the `aria-label` for NavigationMenuRoot to something other than "Main" ?

**@CIMEOS**:

Hello! We have the same issue! We want to customize the NavigationMenuRoot's aria-label for accessibility. In French, aira-label must be written in French. Can we have a solution please ? 

Have a nice day !

# v2.2.0

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Features

- **Calendar**: Expose `grid` and `weekDays` via injection &nbsp;-&nbsp; by @zernonia in https://github.com/unovue/reka-ui/issues/1783 <samp>(b9125)</samp>
- **RovingFocus**: Expose internal component &nbsp;-&nbsp; by @zernonia in https://github.com/unovue/reka-ui/issues/1762 <samp>(41d68)</samp>


### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Possible fix needed

- **RovingFocus**:
  - Should not be active by default &nbsp;-&nbsp; by @zernonia <samp>(1593f)</samp>

> As we expose the Roving Focus component, I realized a bug where `active` is always `true` by default, which shouldn't be the case. 
This will affect your styling/logic that depends on `data-active="true"` for RadioGroup and Tree components. This attribute has been refactored to be present during `active` state only.

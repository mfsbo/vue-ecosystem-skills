# [Feature]: Add a Clear Button to Combobox

### Describe the feature

It would be useful to have an option to display a "clear" button in the Combobox component of Reka UI. This button would allow users to remove the selected value(s) and reset the component to its initial state with no selection.

### Additional information

- [ ] I intend to submit a PR for this feature.
- [ ] I have already implemented and/or tested this feature.

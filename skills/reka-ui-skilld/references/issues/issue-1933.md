# [Feature]: MonthPicker and YearPicker

### Describe the feature

I would like to request dedicated month and year selector components for Reka UI so that developers can easily build date inputs without custom workarounds.

**Month**

**Year**
<img width="247" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a841c974-43b7-42a1-ac3c-7fb42e85fafc" />

A good example of this approach is the `@mantine/dates` library, which has been an inspiration for me.

**Related:** #1730 and nuxt/ui#3094.

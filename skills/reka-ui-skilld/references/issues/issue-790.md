# [Feature]: Add prop to render AccordionContent at all times, but just hide it visually

### Describe the feature

I want to use Accordion, but i also want the text within AccordionContent to be parse-able by crawlers for SEO. Right now, if an AccordionItem is collapsed, the content is deleted from the dom, instead of just hiding it visually.

### Additional information

- [ ] I intend to submit a PR for this feature.
- [ ] I have already implemented and/or tested this feature.

## Starting a new Translation {#starting-a-new-translation}

The Vue documentation has recently undergone a major revision, so translations in other languages are still missing or work-in-progress.

We welcome community efforts to provide more translations. Translation efforts are managed in the vuejs-translations GitHub organization. If you are interested in contributing, please check out the Translation Guidelines to get started.

# TransitionGroup {#transitiongroup}

`<TransitionGroup>` is a built-in component designed for animating the insertion, removal, and order change of elements or components that are rendered in a list.

## Differences from `<Transition>` {#differences-from-transition}

`<TransitionGroup>` supports the same props, CSS transition classes, and JavaScript hook listeners as `<Transition>`, with the following differences:

- By default, it doesn't render a wrapper element. But you can specify an element to be rendered with the `tag` prop.

- [Transition modes](./transition#transition-modes) are not available, because we are no longer alternating between mutually exclusive elements.

- Elements inside are **always required** to have a unique `key` attribute.

- CSS transition classes will be applied to individual elements in the list, **not** to the group / container itself.

:::tip
When used in [in-DOM templates](/guide/essentials/component-basics#in-dom-template-parsing-caveats), it should be referenced as `<transition-group>`.

## Enter / Leave Transitions {#enter-leave-transitions}

Here is an example of applying enter / leave transitions to a `v-for` list using `<TransitionGroup>`:

```vue-html
<TransitionGroup name="list" tag="ul">
  <li v-for="item in items" :key="item">
    {{ item }}
  </li>
</TransitionGroup>
```

```css
.list-enter-active,
.list-leave-active {
  transition: all 0.5s ease;
}
.list-enter-from,
.list-leave-to {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateX(30px);
}
```

<ListBasic />

## Move Transitions {#move-transitions}

The above demo has some obvious flaws: when an item is inserted or removed, its surrounding items instantly "jump" into place instead of moving smoothly. We can fix this by adding a few additional CSS rules:

```css{1,13-17}
.list-move, /* apply transition to moving elements */
.list-enter-active,
.list-leave-active {
  transition: all 0.5s ease;
}

.list-enter-from,
.list-leave-to {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateX(30px);
}

/* ensure leaving items are taken out of layout flow so that moving
   animations can be calculated correctly. */
.list-leave-active {
  position: absolute;
}
```

Now it looks much better - even animating smoothly when the whole list is shuffled:

<ListMove />

### Custom TransitionGroup classes {#custom-transitiongroup-classes}

You can also specify custom transition classes for the moving element by passing the `moveClass` prop to `<TransitionGroup>`, just like [custom transition classes on `<Transition>`](/guide/built-ins/transition.html#custom-transition-classes).

## Staggering List Transitions {#staggering-list-transitions}

By communicating with JavaScript transitions through data attributes, it's also possible to stagger transitions in a list. First, we render the index of an item as a data attribute on the DOM element:

```vue-html{11}
<TransitionGroup
  tag="ul"
  :css="false"
  @before-enter="onBeforeEnter"
  @enter="onEnter"
  @leave="onLeave"
>
  <li
    v-for="(item, index) in computedList"
    :key="item.msg"
    :data-index="index"
  >
    {{ item.msg }}
  </li>
</TransitionGroup>
```

Then, in JavaScript hooks, we animate the element with a delay based on the data attribute. This example is using the GSAP library to perform the animation:

```js{5}
function onEnter(el, done) {
  gsap.to(el, {
    opacity: 1,
    height: '1.6em',
    delay: el.dataset.index * 0.15,
    onComplete: done
  })
}
```

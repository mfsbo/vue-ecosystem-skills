# [Bug Report][3.4.11] Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'parentNode')

### Vue version

3.4.11

### Link to minimal reproduction

https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-starter-n6ky34

### Steps to reproduce

Error when using <nuxt-link> navigation.

### What is expected?

No errors, navigate to other page.

### What is actually happening?

```
[Vue warn]: Unhandled error during execution of scheduler flush. This is likely a Vue internals bug. Please open an issue at https://github.com/vuejs/core . 
  at <NuxtLayout> 
  at <App key=3 > 
  at <NuxtRoot>
```
  
```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'parentNode')
at parentNode (chunk-FRWRVS7C.js?v=e55eeb5e:9605:30)
    at ReactiveEffect.componentUpdateFn [as fn] (chunk-FRWRVS7C.js?v=e55eeb5e:7513:11)
    at ReactiveEffect.run (chunk-FRWRVS7C.js?v=e55eeb5e:421:19)
    at instance.update (chunk-FRWRVS7C.js?v=e55eeb5e:7553:17)
    at callWithErrorHandling (chunk-FRWRVS7C.js?v=e55eeb5e:1634:32)
    at flushJobs (chunk-FRWRVS7C.js?v=e55eeb5e:1841:9)
```

The error stops the execution of the page and does not let you navigate.

This bug appears to affect nuxt, see nuxt/nuxt#25179

This one almost made my head explode today, breaking my static pages based on Nuxt. But it is good to know that it was not my fault :)

For me this only worked properly after putting it in the `resolutions` segment of my package.json. Still holding my fingers crossed for this to be solved within the weekend  

```  
"resolutions": {
  "vue": "3.3.8"
},
```

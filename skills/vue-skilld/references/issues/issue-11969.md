### Steps to reproduce

Mouse over `msg1`, `msg2`, `msg3` to see the type hints for each constant: you will see inner type several times instead of one, as before #11442 was merged.

### What is expected?

Mouse over `msg4`, `msg5`, `msg6` to see the type hints for each constant: you will see inner type just once, as it was before changes introduced in #11442.

### What is actually happening?

After the changes introduced in #11442 the `Ref` type has 2 type arguments (for a long period of time it was just one). Type hints for both of  them are shown on mouse over.

They are usually the same, but still shown 2 times. This makes it much more harder to read the inferred type. Before the changes introduced in #11442 reading the types of `Ref`s was much more convenient and I think it is important enough as `ref` is one of the core building blocks of every Vue application and reading complex Typescript types is hard enough already.

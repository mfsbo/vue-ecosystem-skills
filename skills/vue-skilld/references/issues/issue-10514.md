# TypeScript error (TS2590) when defining a prop as a union type of many (> 315) literal values and a non-primitive type

### Vue version

3.4.21

### Link to minimal reproduction

https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-th8k9t?file=src%2FApp.vue

### Steps to reproduce

1. Define a prop named `icon` as a union type of at least 315 literal values and a non-primitive type (e.g. object, array, class,...)
2. Use it via `props.icon`
3. TypeScript raises an error with id `TS2590: Expression produces a union type that is too complex to represent.`
    - `vue-tsc --noEmit` also raises the same error (can try it in the Stackblitz Terminal)
4. Just delete 1 literal string from the union type and the error is gone immediately

### What is expected?

TypeScript shouldn't raise the error as the number of union literal strings is not that large (only 315). In fact, I'm still able to use the union type in other types seamlessly without any issues.

### What is actually happening?

Not sure what is happening but I think the root cause is due to some adjustments on the `DefineProps` type of `@vue/runtime-core` starting from version `3.3.9`.
I tried the same setup on Vue `3.3.8` and no error was raised.

# "Hydration completed but contains mismatches" error not caught by the Vue error handler

### Vue version

3.5

### Link to minimal reproduction

https://play.vuejs.org/#__SSR__eNp9UstqwzAQ/BWhS1MINiHtJTiBNuTQQh+0PQqKsDeJU1kSergB43/vrl2noU1z0+7MSLM7aviNtUkdgc945nNX2sA8hGgXQpeVNS6wpaksWztTsYskpYLoFwe4MXrlnHFLaUN0UIyZg3X7LeiZQudG+8CAeGxOhJGOSl0S9Es+QhKbL1gjNOsFSS1VBJRhRU2pwAWiobztrsjS3jl6xiJAZZUMgBVjGRlO8ZilR30+5sGjp3W5SXbeaBy+e0/wHOklPvBkQ4meBZ/1TgiTSpnP+64XXITx0M+3kH+c6O/8nnqCPzvw4GoQ/IAF6TYQenj1+gh7PB/AyhRRIfsM+ALeqEgee9pt1AXaPuJ1bu+6jEq9efOrfQDth6HIKDHbji84BkWb+m/0H7vT5KrT4e5xi8N3OPF7htDLAqN7kGGbOKkLU40wsnOBbSeLpiFV22YpFn+je6/B0SD46DS5TiZT3n4BfWfvyQ==

### Steps to reproduce

After this change, more hydration mismatch errors are appearing in production. However, Vue's error handlers are unable to catch them, likely because console.error is used directly instead of handleError.

Additionally, it would be helpful if these errors logged more contextual information rather than just a plain string, making debugging easier.

In the provided reproduction link, I introduced a random ID to force a hydration mismatch. However, Vue's error handler does not catch it. I also tested with app.config.errorHandler, but the issue persists.

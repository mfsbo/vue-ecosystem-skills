# [Vue warn] Computed is still dirty after getter evaluation

### Vue version

3.4.19

### Link to minimal reproduction

-

### Steps to reproduce

After the last update I get this warning, but as far as I know I don't have side effects in the computed properties, eslint would warn me about this.
If there are such side effects, the warning is not helping me find them. To make this warning useful it would need to say the name of the computed property. As it is now, it is more just yellow noise in the console.

### What is expected?

To either not show warnings, or if it does, to give me the exact name of the computed property and if possible why it thinks it is dirty.

### What is actually happening?

I get warnings I can't act upon.

### System Info

```shell
System:
    OS: Windows 10 10.0.19045
    CPU: (16) x64 AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor

  Binaries:
    Node: 20.11.0 - C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.EXE
    npm: 10.2.4 - C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.CMD
  Browsers:
    Edge: Chromium (121.0.2277.112)
    Internet Explorer: 11.0.19041.3636
  npmPackages:
    vue: ^3.4.19 => 3.4.19
```


### Any additional comments?

I am not sure if the computed properties it complains about are actual computed declared in the component or state data imported with `mapState` or `mapGetters`

Agreed with @solaris7791 and @csicky. More information about the name of the computed and why, or at least being able to have some sort of configuration. I linked a pinia playground here:

Hi, it would be helpful to know the name of the computed triggering the warning, also if possible a way to know why the warning was triggered (for example it changed x times in x timespan). I do have in many places computed cascading, like one using up another and on and on, but in my opinion that should not trigger. Also I would like to know if the `mapState and mapGetters` does trigger this.

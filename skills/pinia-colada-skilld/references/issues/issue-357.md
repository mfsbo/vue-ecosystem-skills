# Integrate all @pinia/colada-devtools functionality as an official Vue devtools plugin

Currently Pinia Colada has a Vue devtools plugin (Included as part or Pinia Colada itself) and also it's own additional component that has additional dev functionality. It would be nice to integrate such functionality into the official Vue devtools plugin instead of needing a separate component that needs to be separately installed.

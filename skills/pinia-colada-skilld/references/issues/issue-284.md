# Docs: Error handling

Hello!

I was searching the documentation site for information on error handling. The search pointed me to the "Error handling" page (https://pinia-colada.esm.dev/guide/error-handling.html), but I couldn't find any public link to this page (for example, in the "Guide" menu).

Just a friendly curiosity, is the information on this page not finished yet, or is this a menu configuration error for Vitest?

# [Feature]: Shadcn/vue extended

### Describe the feature

 
Shadcn/UI has a great community extension, listed on Awesome Shadcn UI. Inspired by this, we want to provide the same opportunities for the Vue community by introducing the `shadcn-vue-extended` repository.  

With this initiative, you can:  
- Suggest custom components and contribute via PRs  
- Easily deploy the component registry and documentation  
- Gain more visibility for your components  
- Give back to the community  

We will be moving the following components to the extended repository (and their relevant tickets):  
1. AutoForm  
2. Chart  

We’d love to hear your thoughts!  

### Additional information

- [ ] I intend to submit a PR for this feature.
- [ ] I have already implemented and/or tested this feature.

@ThimoDEV  we wanted to keep the `shadcn/vue` as close to main `shadcn` as possible. This allow for quick follow up to latest changes. 

The idea of extended repo is to allow community to be creative, and take credit and ownership for the components they created. This would also improve the time to review PR.

Thanks @adiramardiani for the component suggestions. However in order to not flood this PR with requests, I've hidden them as `off-topic` (we can create the tickets in the new repo). Let's have this ticket focusing on thoughts and idea

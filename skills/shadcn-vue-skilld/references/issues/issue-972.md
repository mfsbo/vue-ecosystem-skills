# [Feature]: Add a color picker component

### Describe the feature

One of my recent projects used a date picker component, but I noticed that a color picker component was missing.
So, can you try adding

example:
``` vue
  <ColorPicker value='#000000' format='rgba' />
```

### Additional information

- [ ] I intend to submit a PR for this feature.
- [ ] I have already implemented and/or tested this feature.

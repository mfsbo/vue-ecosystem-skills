# [Feature]: direction of drawer

### Describe the feature

vaul-vue supports setting `direction`, but Shadcn's style does not provide good support for `direction`. If `direction=left` is set, it is still a bottom drawer, but it appears and disappears from the left.

Are there any plans to implement this function?

### Additional information

- [ ] I intend to submit a PR for this feature.
- [ ] I have already implemented and/or tested this feature.

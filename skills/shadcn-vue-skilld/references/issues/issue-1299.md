# [Feature]: Synchronization with Latest shadcn/ui Updates

### Describe the feature

Hello shadcn-vue team,

I hope this message finds you well. First, I'd like to express my appreciation for the excellent work you've done in bringing shadcn/ui to the Vue ecosystem. The project has been incredibly valuable to the Vue community.

I've been following the recent updates to the original shadcn/ui project and noticed that there have been some exciting new features and improvements introduced. I believe it would be beneficial for shadcn-vue users to have access to these enhancements as well.

I'd like to respectfully suggest considering the synchronization of the following updates from shadcn/ui to maintain feature parity and ensure shadcn-vue users can benefit from the latest improvements.

Below are the specific areas where I've identified differences that could be addressed:

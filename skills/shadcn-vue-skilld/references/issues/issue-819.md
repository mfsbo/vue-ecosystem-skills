Yo guys! The same functionalities for Sidebar will be added. 
For extra feature please raised them on the main `ui.shadcn` repo yaa

Yoo guys.. a quick update on this. (sorry I couldn't get much done this week as I had function oversea)

This ticket will have dependency on https://github.com/unovue/shadcn-vue/issues/805 to add sidebar blocks to your app. 
I will handle this sidebar feature in 2 steps. 

1. Add `sidebar` component to component registry (you will then be able to use them into your project, but you need to build the sidebar yourself)
2. Add `sidebar` blocks after New CLI (this will add sidebar blocks into your project directly)

Hi @zernonia thanks for your great work!

I really wanted to use the new Sidebar, installed with npx... it adds over 20 components to ui/sidebar
but there is no example in the docs how to create a simple Sidebar or how to use any of the components..

Do have any estimate when instruction of how-to-use will be added to docs?
Or is there a link for a basic example implementing the Sidebar component?

Thank you!! :pray:

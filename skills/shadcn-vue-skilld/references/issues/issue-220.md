**@zernonia** [maintainer] (+5):

Love the initiative @connerblanton  @Elliot-Alexander  ... We are glad to have the package move under `radix-vue` if you guys don't mind it  



**@Elliot-Alexander** (+11):

I've started looking at porting Vaul to Vue, first time doing something like this so will update with progress

**@connerblanton** (+8):

@Elliot-Alexander and anyone else interested - I have also started porting Vaul to Vue. It's also the first time I have attempted anything like this so not entirely sure what I'm doing . 

It is still very much a work in progress but it is currently functional.

Repo - https://github.com/connerblanton/vue-vaul

Feel free to fork it, make PRs, use it as a reference or whatever you feel like. I am very interested in getting this ported to Vue and don't care if it's my repo, yours, or someone else's. Just excited for all of us to get something working and to see what we can build together...

# Form or Field Component?

Hello everyone,

As I'm starting a new project with shadcn-vue, I wanted to ask for some guidance on the recommended best practice for building forms.
I've noticed we have two great options: the original  component family with its convenient, tight integration with vee-validate, and the newer, more flexible <Field /> component family, which seems to align with the future direction of the core shadcn/ui library.

My question is purely about strategy: For new projects, what is the recommended path forward? Is the intention for the community to migrate towards using the <Field /> components, or are both considered equally valid and supported approaches for the foreseeable future?

I'm trying to decide which pattern to adopt for the best long-term maintainability.
Thanks for sharing your insights!

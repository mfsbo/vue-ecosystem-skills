# Can't resolve 'tw-animate-css'

A one day ago, I encountered a problem when initiating a project using **Schadcn-vue + JavaScript**. After installing the project and adding a tailwindcss, I received an "**[plugin:@tailwindcss/vite:generate:serve] Can't resolve 'tw-animate-css**'" error. 
Could you please advise me on how to resolve this error? 
The project initiation process was previously the same and there were no problems with it.

**@fontanaen**:

Did you add `@import "tw-animate-css";` into your `style.css` ?

Also install `tw-animate-css` package

I think this is missing from actual doc

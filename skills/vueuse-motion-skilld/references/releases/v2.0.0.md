# v2.0.0

This PR follows the notes on #81.

It contains quite a lot of breaking changes that has been spread across the last **29** beta versions that has been released.

As mentioned in the issue, the most notable one is the **drop of Vue 2 support**.

Be aware that all the coming versions of `@vueuse/motion` will only support **Vue 3**.

## New maintainer

@cpreston321 is joining the repository and will help efforts stabilizing the v2 and moving towards a v3 that is lighter and has better API and features.

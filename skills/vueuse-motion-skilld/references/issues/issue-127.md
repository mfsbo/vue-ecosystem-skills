# Docs: Move `demo` into `docs`

I used to maintain this website showcasing capabilities: https://vueuse-motion-demo.netlify.app

At the time it was introduced, none of `@vueuse/motion` was built with Nuxt nor `@nuxt/content`.

Now that we have `MDC` and syntax coloring from `@nuxt/content`, I would love to have some great examples for the usage "from the code" with a nice sandbox showcasing it close.

Much like we do for presets but with a bit more of code!

WDYT @cpreston321 @alex-eliot?

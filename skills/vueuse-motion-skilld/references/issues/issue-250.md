# [Feature request] - Controlling the threshold in the Visible variants??

Hi,

This is a feature request  

Can we add the functionality to the Visible variants (visible/visibleOnce) such that we can pass in a threshold (how much of the element as a percentage is intersecting the viewport) where (0 < n < 1) and that defines the moment the variant 'fires'  , similar to how threshold works in useIntersectionObserver.

Much appreciated,
Dwayne

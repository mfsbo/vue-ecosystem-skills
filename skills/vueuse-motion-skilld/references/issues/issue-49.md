# Timeline

I think I need something like https://popmotion.io/api/timeline/

Do you think there is a way to fit this in @vueuse/motion ?

I'd like to help and make a PR but I am not sure how to get started.

Thanks

Hello!

This is one of the features I would like to implement!

Do you have any ideas about how you would implement the API?

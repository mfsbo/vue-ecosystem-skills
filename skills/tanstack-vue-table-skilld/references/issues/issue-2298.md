**@tannerlinsley** [maintainer] (+1):

The github docs have returned temporarily while we figure out what to do with the docs.

**@kuzdogan** (+4):

For those who need the documentation until this gets fixed, the files are already in the repo: https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table/tree/master/docs 

Should be well human-readable as they are markdown formatted.

# Thank you for this library

Hey,

Just started using `react-table` and wanted to say thanks for such a great job. Customization is so well through-out that I’m just enjoying working with it: I can change almost every detail to adapt the table for design requirements; and, at the same time, I need to change only a small number of things because defaults also work very well. And the number of features just blows my mind.

Thank you. Such an amazing job.

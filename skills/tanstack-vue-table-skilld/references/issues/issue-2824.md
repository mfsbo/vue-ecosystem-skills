# Re-rendering a cell (by edit) renders the whole table

I am using the latest version 7.6.1, and I am hitting the issue that after I edit a single cell, I see the entire table being re-render. 

This is similar with the issue called out here: https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table/issues/754 as far as I am reading. 

Has been made any progress on the rendering performance for this table? I am planning to use it in a production system and this is a big blocker to move forward with it. 

Thanks for any info.

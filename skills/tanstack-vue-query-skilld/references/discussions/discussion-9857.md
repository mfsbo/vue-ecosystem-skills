# Will `react-query-next-experimental` support Next.js 16

Hello,

I see that `@tanstack/react-query-next-experimental` can support up to Next.js 15 in its' peer dependencies.
I don't know whether it will take a simple bump or a lot of things have changed under the hood in version 16, so I wanted to ask if it makes sense to have the package updated?

Choosing a routing solution? This side‑by‑side comparison highlights key features, trade‑offs, and common use cases to help you quickly evaluate how each option fits your project’s needs.

While we aim to provide an accurate and fair comparison, please note that this table may not capture every nuance or recent update of each library. We recommend reviewing the official documentation and trying out each solution to make the most informed decision for your specific use case.

If you find any discrepancies or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to contribute via the "Edit this page on GitHub" link at the bottom of this page or open an issue in the TanStack Router GitHub repository.

# useTRPC() can only be used inside of a <TRPCProvider>

I just installed the tanstack app using `npm create @tanstack/start@latest` and selected the TRPC support 

When i got to the http://localhost:3000/demo/trpc-todo it throws the error

```
useTRPC() can only be used inside of a <TRPCProvider>
```

PS: This example here https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/examples/with-trpc?path=examples%2Freact%2Fwith-trpc%2Fsrc%2Fmain.tsx seems to be outdate also=

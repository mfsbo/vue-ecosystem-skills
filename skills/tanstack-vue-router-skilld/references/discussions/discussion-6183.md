# Changelog for eslint plugin?

I got a notification from renovate that I can update @tanstack/eslint-plugin-router, but I am having a tough time determining what changes actually occurred from `1.139.0` to `1.141.0`.  Digging through the GitHub releases is just about impossible, since there are so many, and most don't apply to the linting plugin.  I don't see any changelog in `packages/eslint-plugin-router` either.  Is there any good way to actually determine what has changed?

**@schiller-manuel**:

that plugin shouldnt have changed but might just have been bumped.

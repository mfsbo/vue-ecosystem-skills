# XYLabels with GroupedBar chart

Hello everyone,

I'm trying to use the `VisXYLabels` component together with the `VisGroupedBar` component, but it seems I can't render a label on top of each bar within a single group.

I've tried several options, but so far I can only render a label above the middle bar of each group.

Is this unsupported, or am I missing something? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

And if this is unsupported how would you look to support this?

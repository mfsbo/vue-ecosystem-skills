# VisCrosshair not working with update 1.3.0

The VisCrosshair is not working any more with update 1.3.0 because:

```
Unovis | Crosshair: Y accessors have not been configured. Please check if they're present in the configuration object
Unovis | Crosshair: X accessor function has not been configured. Please check if it's present in the configuration object
```

The wrong behaviour is also in your website:

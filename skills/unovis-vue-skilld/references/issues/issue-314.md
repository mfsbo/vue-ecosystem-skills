# Make number of grid line to tick label ratio configurable 

Hello everyone, thank you for the great library.

I just noticed that the number of grid lines rendered from the Axis component always be 2 per tick label rendered in the chart, can we make this number (2) configurable? so there will be always tick labels on every grid line in the axis

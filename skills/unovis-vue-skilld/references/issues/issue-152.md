The Vue 3 integration has been merged into the main branch  Kudos to @zernonia for this amazing contribution!

It'll be officially announced with the 1.3.0 release, but you you want to use it already, use version `1.3.0-beta.3`: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@unovis/vue/v/1.3.0-beta.3

Hey @rokotyan ! Im the maintainer for Radix Vue &  Shadcn Vue, and I would love to contribute to this Vue3 integration. Could you assign this to me? 

**@errantmind** (+1):

I'm using Unovis with Vue3 and plain javascript and it works fine. I mostly referenced the Typescript docs and then mentally translated that to javascript where necessary. There were a few gotchas to get it to re-render properly when Vue state changes, but it is doable. Let me know if you run into any issues here @eladcandroid  and I'll try to help.

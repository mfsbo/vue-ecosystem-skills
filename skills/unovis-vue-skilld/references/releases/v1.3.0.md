# Release 1.3.0

Unovis 1.3 introduces Vue support and a new pattern theme to further improve our support for accessibility features.

### Release Highlights
####  Vue 3 support
Long-awaited support for Vue, the third most popular front-end UI framework. Kudos to our community member @zernonia for this amazing contribution!

####  Patterns
A new theme with pattern fills that can be enabled by adding the `theme-patterns` class to the `body` element of your document. See the documentation and this pull request for more details.

# Future of this library

Hi guys, 

I'm wondering, what are the plans for this library? Can we expect libraries like @tanstack/query to be rebuilt on top of @tanstack/store? If I'm not mistaken, only @tanstack/pacer is using this store as of now. 

Thanks for any info!

There is a big future for TanStack Store, we're just taking our time making it right before encouraging general use. Eventually, this will be our most foundational library.

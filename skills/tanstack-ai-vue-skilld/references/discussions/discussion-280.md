# The ai-*-ui packages are too outdated

# The ai-*-ui packages are too outdated

- There are too few components
- They don't work intuitively
- They are not fully typesafe (e.g. tool usage)

These problems force you to import components from the `ai-sdk` library.

As such, I think we should bootstrap on top of an existing library like ShadCN, BaseUI or other and start from scratch, fully typesafe components.

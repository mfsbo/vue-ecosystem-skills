# Openai compatible provider

Will there be a openai-compatible provider? I would like to use other models(e.g. kimi and glm) which implements the OpenAI API. In vercel ai-sdk it works well with https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/openai-compatible-providers.

## Accepted Answer

We haven't still gotten to implementing anything outside the 4 standard ones we offer atm. We tried to cover 90% of cases but we're aware the 10% is missing.

We definitely plan on tackling this, bedrock... and all other adapters in the future!

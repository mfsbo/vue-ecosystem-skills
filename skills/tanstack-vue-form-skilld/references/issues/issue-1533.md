# [Docs] Form Authoring Recommendation Docs

This document should outline the two approaches enabled by Form:

- Form first
- Field first

Where field-first is more JSX template heavy and form-first is more standard schema focused.

We should provide an official recommendation for form-first.

However, those that prefer field-first APIs or need one-off behaviors can still use fields; it just centralizes more logic in your JSX

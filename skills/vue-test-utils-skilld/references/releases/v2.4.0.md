# v2.4.0

**Note**: there *might* be some minor breaking changes around types. We tried hard to avoid this and tested a few different projects, but there was some major under the hood changes relating to types (which should improve the TypeScript experience). See the note at the top of the previous release, 2.4.0-alpha.2: https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils/releases/tag/v2.4.0-alpha.2

Between the last main release, v2.3.2, and v2.4.0, there were three alphas:

- https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils/releases/tag/v2.4.0-alpha.0
- https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils/releases/tag/v2.4.0-alpha.1
- https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils/releases/tag/v2.4.0-alpha.2

Please see those release notes for changes if you are updating from v2.3.2. Again, there should not be any major changes, and you code and tests should continue to work as before without any changes.

If you do encounter breaking changes transitioning from 2.3.x -> 2.4.x, please file an issue.

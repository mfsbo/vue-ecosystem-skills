# v2.4.2

## What's Changed

Note: A fix for the `text()` method (https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils/pull/2231) may force developers to update tests that were checking the text of several elements at once, as the spaces of each element are now trimmed (as they are when using `text()` on a single element). So if you were checking the text of `<span>Trimmed </span><span>Example</span>`, it is now `TrimmedExample` instead of `Trimmed Example` (and the `text()` of the first span is still `Trimmed` as it was before).
